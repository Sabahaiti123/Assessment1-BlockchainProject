This is a basic Python blockchain system created for the INFO6001 assignment. The program shows how a blockchain works by letting users add data to blocks, link them using hashes, and check if the chain is still valid.

The program starts with a genesis block. Users can add blocks with their own data. Each block includes an index, timestamp, user data, proof number, and a hash. SHA-256 is used to hash the contents, and each block links to the one before it.

A simple text menu lets users add blocks, view the chain, or validate it. The validation checks if all blocks are properly linked and unchanged. 

This project is for learning purposes only. It runs in the terminal or any Python environment and does not include networking or data saving.
